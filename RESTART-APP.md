# ðŸ”„ Restart Required

I've fixed the configuration so your Angular app will load properly!

## What Was Wrong:
The root endpoint `/` was returning a JSON message instead of serving your Angular app.

## What I Fixed:
- âœ… Removed the conflicting root endpoint
- âœ… Added explicit route to serve Angular at `/`
- âœ… Fixed catch-all route to serve static files (JS, CSS)
- âœ… Angular routing will now work properly

## ðŸš€ How to Restart:

### Option 1: Quick Restart
1. **Close the desktop window** (the one showing the API message)
2. **Double-click `TaskManager.bat` again**

### Option 2: Command Line
1. Close the current window
2. Run: `python launch_desktop.py`

## âœ… What You'll See Now:
- Your full Angular application UI
- Not just a JSON message!
- All Angular routes will work
- Static files (JS, CSS) will load properly

---

**Go ahead and restart the app now!** ðŸŽ‰
